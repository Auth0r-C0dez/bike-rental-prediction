Bike Rental Prediction 🚲
A machine learning model to predict daily bike rentals based on weather, seasonal trends, and user data.

📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to analyze and predict bike rental demand based on multiple factors like:
✔ Weather conditions 🌦
✔ Time of the year 📅
✔ User behavior 👥

Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this model helps in optimizing bike-sharing systems.
